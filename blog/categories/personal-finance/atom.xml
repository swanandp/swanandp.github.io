    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>How do you know your finances are in order? Are you on the right track? What should you do next?</p>

<p>Here is an essential checklist for good financial health. Do these things first, and then you can seek an advisor, planner, or wealth manager based on your needs. This list is <em>not an end-goal</em>; instead, it&rsquo;s a pre-requisite.</p>

<p>tl;dr 👇🏼</p>

<ul>
<li>Contingency Funds 💵</li>
<li>Term and Health Insurance 🏥</li>
<li>Equity to Debt Ratio ⚖️</li>
<li>Controlled expenses and regular investments 📈</li>
</ul>


<h2>1. Contingency Funds</h2>

<p>Save one full year of expenses in capital-preserved, safe financial instruments. These are ALL YOUR outgoing expenses: monthly rentals, EMIs, school fees, planned necessary purchases for the upcoming year. Name one, name all. Even if the markets crash and the economy tumbles, you need access to these funds.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s quite likely that you are not in a position to put the whole year&rsquo;s worth in one go. In such a case, aim lower and build it up. Three months first, followed by six, then maybe ten, and finally, the whole year. Find your path.</p>

<p>A contingency fund is far more critical than low performing investments. Liquidate your worst performing and worst future-outlook assets if you need to. Many people have a baggage of LIC policies, ULIPs, under-performing mutual funds. Often taken from well-meaning family friends who don&rsquo;t really know better. Research and swap them out. Guilt-free! Some well-known avenues for research:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://capitalmind.in/">https://capitalmind.in/</a></li>
<li><a href="https://indmoney.com/">https://indmoney.com/</a></li>
<li><a href="https://app.bankoncube.com/lead/upload/">https://app.bankoncube.com/lead/upload/</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.smallcase.com/creators">https://www.smallcase.com/creators</a> (Curated list of advisors)</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Why is your emergency fund necessary?</strong> <br/>
A contingency fund instantly improves your risk appetite. You can afford some additional risk because your baseline is now firm.</p>

<p>A contingency fund will make you look at your current debts and liabilities. Do you have high-interest loans? Are you earning from your mutual funds but losing out on the interest? Now would be a good time evaluate and get rid of those as much as you can. Stop bad debt.</p>

<p>It also helps you get into a positive mindset. You can do things like taking a break, leaving a toxic job, trying something new, spending time with family, maybe even vacations. When you are not worried about putting food on the table, you can think better about other essential items.  🧘🏼‍♂️</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re constantly worried about not having money, you will make poor choices out of a need for safety. Avoid that. Consider this anecdote from a friend:</p>

<blockquote><p>I left my job without another one in hand because I knew I had four months of runaway saved up. That same runway helped me reject a not-so-good offer because of the same mentality: I wanted to wait for a better offer to come my way.</p></blockquote>

<p>It&rsquo;s liberating.</p>

<h2>2. Term and Health Insurance</h2>

<p>Get appropriate amounts of insurance. How much is appropriate?</p>

<p><strong>Term insurance:</strong> 20x of your family&rsquo;s total annual expenses. If you Google around, you will find plenty of credible calculators from reputed institutions. But 15x or 20x is a good number. Start there.</p>

<p>Term insurance is needed many reasons, the two essentials reasons are this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Your existing liabilities shouldn&rsquo;t burden your dependents</li>
<li>Loss of an earning member shouldn&rsquo;t put them in a position where they need to scramble for putting food on the table. Remember the reasons we set up the contingency fund? Similar reasoning.</li>
</ul>


<p>Optimize for a hassle-free disbursement and high settlement ratio, not merely for a low premium. When the need arises to claim your insurance, your family and loved ones will be grieving. They won&rsquo;t be in a position to think through. Don&rsquo;t set them up for further doom. 🤞🏼</p>

<p><strong>Health insurance:</strong> This is a far more nuanced discussion, but take as high a cover as you can. 20L, 30L, higher! Let your budget and comfort guide you. There are plans like &ldquo;super top-up&rdquo; that raise your floor by a considerable margin. Utilize them.</p>

<p>The idea is not to leave your dependents and loved ones stranded.</p>

<h2>3. Equity to Debt Ratio</h2>

<p>Not counting your emergency fund, make sure you have a healthy distribution of equity and debt instruments —  60:40 and 70:30 are extremely popular ratios, and for a good reason. The central idea behind the balance is, of course, risk negation.</p>

<p>Your equity exposure drives your growth, and your debt portfolio gives you stability.</p>

<p>Use planning services to gauge your ratio and work on improving it first. If you have too much equity, stop your equity SIPs and switch to debt instead and vice versa. Give yourself a year to fix the ratio.</p>

<p>Debt instruments are not to be judged based on their year-over-year growth. No. That is not their primary job. Having a good, firm debt portfolio enables you to take risks in your equity game. This way, even if your equity risks try to bring you down, your stability from debt will shield you.</p>

<p>I will repeat, your equity exposure drives your growth, and your debt portfolio gives you stability.</p>

<h2>4. Controlled expenses and regular investments</h2>

<p>None of the above will matter if you can&rsquo;t control your expenditure or don&rsquo;t invest regularly. It&rsquo;s a commitment, no less. I have <a href="/blog/2020/05/31/spending-less/">written about spending less</a> before.</p>

<p>Spending as little as you can and investing as much as you can is almost a lifestyle. The good thing is you get to decide what &ldquo;little&rdquo; and &ldquo;much&rdquo; mean to you.</p>

<h2>What next?</h2>

<p><strong>That&rsquo;s all, folks!</strong> You have everything you need, and you are now ready for a more advanced course of action. This course of action looks something like:</p>

<ul>
<li>Portfolio management services (PMS)</li>
<li>Certified financial planners (CFP)</li>
<li>Self-guided investments</li>
</ul>


<p>PMS is an excellent choice if you can afford it. For advisory and planning, the world is moving towards a &ldquo;fee-only&rdquo; model. It&rsquo;s hard to make the incentives align in a commissions model. Services like Clearcase are making it easy for us to take our own investment decisions. YMMV!</p>

<p>Let your budget and risk appetite guide you. Consult experts for all critical and specific decisions like where to invest and which policies to take.</p>

<p>Happy investing! 💰</p>

    <link href="http://info.pagnis.in/blog/2020/05/31/spending-less/"/>
    <updated>2020-05-31T20:30:05+05:30</updated>
    <id>http://info.pagnis.in/blog/2020/05/31/spending-less</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There are four popular ways of growing your wealth:</p>

<ol>
<li>Spending less</li>
<li>Investing wisely</li>
<li>Earning more</li>
<li>Getting lucky</li>
</ol>


<p>They all differ in their effectiveness and difficulty of implementation.</p>

<ol>
<li>Spending less:  the easiest of all</li>
<li>Investing wisely: difficult; requires expertise</li>
<li>Earning more: not easy, but the most effective</li>
<li>Getting lucky: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</li>
</ol>


<p>&ldquo;Spending less&rdquo; is the low hanging fruit out of the four. It&rsquo;s directly tied to human behavior, and we can apply techniques backed by research to help us spend less.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>The Science</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://www.behaviormodel.org/">Fogg Behavior Model</a> states that behavior occurs at the intersection of 3 things:</p>

<ol>
<li><em>Prompt</em> for an action</li>
<li><em>Motivation</em> to do the action</li>
<li><em>Ability</em> to perform the action</li>
</ol>


<p><img src="http://info.pagnis.in/assets/b-eq-map_small@2x.jpg" alt="Fogg Behavior Model" width="75%" /></p>

<p><sub>Image used with appropriate permission from BJ Fogg</sub></p>

<p>Some examples:</p>

<ul>
<li>Upon encountering a bug 🐞 in the Linux OS (<em>prompt</em>), I may have a strong desire (<em>motivation</em>) to submit a patch to the Linux kernel, but it&rsquo;s well beyond my <em>ability</em> to do so. I will not do it. 😅</li>
<li>After brushing my teeth in the morning (<em>prompt</em>), I can easily do 20 pushups (<em>ability</em>). But. I. Just. Want. My. Coffee. ☕ (<em>motivation</em>)</li>
<li>I see a bowl of cashews and dates on the dinner table (<em>prompt</em>). I love dates (<em>motivation</em>). I will pick them up and eat (<em>ability</em>)</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>To summarise:</strong></p>

<p>When we&rsquo;re prompted to act, if we have the <em>ability</em> to do it <strong>and</strong> high enough a <em>motivation</em> to do it, we do it. If either is lacking, we don&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>Spending falls in this same model.</p>

<ul>
<li>You&rsquo;re on Twitter, someone tweets a picture of something enticing you&rsquo;ve been thinking buying, you go to Amazon and buy it with a few clicks. ✅</li>
<li>A friend tells you about an excellent book they&rsquo;re reading; you go to Goodreads, find the reviews and descriptions. You&rsquo;re convinced. You buy. ✅</li>
<li>You hear about a great electric bike that looks fabulous and seems like a perfect fit for you. You notice the price is way out of your budget. You don&rsquo;t buy it. 🚫</li>
</ul>


<p>So how do we use what we learned above? Often the easiest way is to remove the prompts. It works like a charm. But it&rsquo;s not always possible. The prompts <em>will</em> occur, and we will have to rely on reduced motivation and reduced ability to prevent the action.</p>

<h2>A strategy for minimizing spending</h2>

<ul>
<li>Figure out a reasonable expenditure cap for your household, say ₹ X0,000/month 💸</li>
<li>This includes all outgoing: rents, EMIs, groceries, eat-outs, credit card payments, shopping, what have you. 🏠 🛍️ 🥘 (Review this figure twice a year)</li>
<li>Dedicate an account for these expenses. Each month, put this amount there. Direct ALL YOUR SPENDING to <em>this</em> account. <em>All.</em> 🔑</li>
<li>When you run out of money in this account, DO NOT SPEND. 🙅🏼‍♂️ 🚫</li>
<li>If you use credit cards, you can only spend what you have in THIS ACCOUNT. No more. No converting into EMIs. 💳</li>
<li>Do not deviate far from your personality. e.g., I love occasional shopping and splurging, and so I account for it. Moderation is key. Without it, you will fall off the wagon quickly. ✋🏼 🛑</li>
<li>If you can, rely on spouses, partners, parents, children for accountability. Return the favor and be accountable for them. 👪</li>
<li>Account for annual, non-monthly, and aperiodic expenses. Insurance policies, vacations, school fees, furniture, laptops, what have you.  🎒 🏖 🏔️ 💻</li>
<li>Distribute the amount monthly. Put it in liquid funds (consult experts for this) connected to the same spending account. 💰</li>
<li>Direct ALL THOSE EXPENSES to <em>this</em> account. <em>All.</em> 🔑</li>
<li>Seeding/overdraft: Sometimes significant expenses come before you&rsquo;ve accrued enough in the expense account. Have an overdraft margin for it and treat it as a loan to yourself.</li>
<li>A reasonable limit allows you to spend just enough to have a happy lifestyle and yet limits spending. ⚖️</li>
</ul>


<h2>Parting thoughts</h2>

<p>We accepted that spending prompts <em>will</em> occur. By decreasing our ability to spend we&rsquo;ve pushed the prompt from action zone to no action zone.</p>

<p>Relying on motivation alone is a strategy fraught with peril. By gaming ability and prompts, you can prevent bad behavior or encourage good behavior. Spending less is just one tiny application of this powerful technique.</p>
