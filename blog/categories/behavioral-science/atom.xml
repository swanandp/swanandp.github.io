    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There are four popular ways of growing your wealth:</p>

<ol>
<li>Spending less</li>
<li>Investing wisely</li>
<li>Earning more</li>
<li>Getting lucky</li>
</ol>


<p>They all differ in their effectiveness and difficulty of implementation.</p>

<ol>
<li>Spending less:  the easiest of all</li>
<li>Investing wisely: difficult; requires expertise</li>
<li>Earning more: not easy, but the most effective</li>
<li>Getting lucky: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</li>
</ol>


<p>&ldquo;Spending less&rdquo; is the low hanging fruit out of the four. It&rsquo;s directly tied to human behavior, and we can apply techniques backed by research to help us spend less.</p>

<h2>The Science</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://www.behaviormodel.org/">Fogg Behavior Model</a> states that behavior occurs at the intersection of 3 things:</p>

<ol>
<li><em>Prompt</em> for an action</li>
<li><em>Motivation</em> to do the action</li>
<li><em>Ability</em> to perform the action</li>
</ol>

<p>Some examples:</p>

<ul>
<li>Upon encountering a bug 🐞 in the Linux OS (<em>prompt</em>), I may have a strong desire (<em>motivation</em>) to submit a patch to the Linux kernel, but it&rsquo;s well beyond my <em>ability</em> to do so. I will not do it. 😅</li>
<li>After brushing my teeth in the morning (<em>prompt</em>), I can easily do 20 pushups (<em>ability</em>). But. I. Just. Want. My. Coffee. ☕ (<em>motivation</em>)</li>
<li>I see a bowl of cashews and dates on the dinner table (<em>prompt</em>). I love dates (<em>motivation</em>). I will pick them up and eat (<em>ability</em>)</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>To summarise:</strong></p>

<p>When we&rsquo;re prompted to act, if we have the <em>ability</em> to do it <strong>and</strong> high enough a <em>motivation</em> to do it, we do it. If either is lacking, we don&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>Spending falls in this same model.</p>

<ul>
<li>You&rsquo;re on Twitter, someone tweets a picture of something enticing you&rsquo;ve been thinking buying, you go to Amazon and buy it with a few clicks. ✅</li>
<li>A friend tells you about an excellent book they&rsquo;re reading; you go to Goodreads, find the reviews and descriptions. You&rsquo;re convinced. You buy. ✅</li>
<li>You hear about a great electric bike that looks fabulous and seems like a perfect fit for you. You notice the price is way out of your budget. You don&rsquo;t buy it. 🚫</li>
</ul>


<p>So how do we use what we learned above? Often the easiest way is to remove the prompts. It works like a charm. But it&rsquo;s not always possible. The prompts <em>will</em> occur, and we will have to rely on reduced motivation and reduced ability to prevent the action.</p>

<h2>A strategy for minimizing spending</h2>

<ul>
<li>Figure out a reasonable expenditure cap for your household, say ₹ X0,000/month 💸</li>
<li>This includes all outgoing: rents, EMIs, groceries, eat-outs, credit card payments, shopping, what have you. 🏠 🛍️ 🥘 (Review this figure twice a year)</li>
<li>Dedicate an account for these expenses. Each month, put this amount there. Direct ALL YOUR SPENDING to <em>this</em> account. <em>All.</em> 🔑</li>
<li>When you run out of money in this account, DO NOT SPEND. 🙅🏼‍♂️ 🚫</li>
<li>If you use credit cards, you can only spend what you have in THIS ACCOUNT. No more. No converting into EMIs. 💳</li>
<li>Do not deviate far from your personality. e.g., I love occasional shopping and splurging, and so I account for it. Moderation is key. Without it, you will fall off the wagon quickly. ✋🏼 🛑</li>
<li>If you can, rely on spouses, partners, parents, children for accountability. Return the favor and be accountable for them. 👪</li>
<li>Account for annual, non-monthly, and aperiodic expenses. Insurance policies, vacations, school fees, furniture, laptops, what have you.  🎒 🏖 🏔️ 💻</li>
<li>Distribute the amount monthly. Put it in liquid funds (consult experts for this) connected to the same spending account. 💰</li>
<li>Direct ALL THOSE EXPENSES to <em>this</em> account. <em>All.</em> 🔑</li>
<li>Seeding/overdraft: Sometimes significant expenses come before you&rsquo;ve accrued enough in the expense account. Have an overdraft margin for it and treat it as a loan to yourself.</li>
<li>A reasonable limit allows you to spend just enough to have a happy lifestyle and yet limits spending. ⚖️</li>
</ul>


<h2>Parting thoughts</h2>

<p>We accepted that spending prompts <em>will</em> occur. By decreasing our ability to spend we&rsquo;ve pushed the prompt from action zone to no action zone.</p>

<p>Relying on motivation alone is a strategy fraught with peril. By gaming ability and prompts, you can prevent bad behavior or encourage good behavior. Spending less is just one tiny application of this powerful technique.</p>
