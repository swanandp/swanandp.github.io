    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Back in 2019, I wrote a job post that I soon became fond of. Proud even. It received healthy attention and consistent praise:</p>

<ul>
<li>To the point without unnecessary fluff</li>
<li>Exciting and warm to read</li>
<li>Mentorship offered</li>
<li>Thank you for no buzzwords</li>
</ul>


<p>It also buried me in applications and responses. A good problem to have! Publishing the post here for posterity&rsquo;s sake.</p>

<h2>Join the team at Deserve! 🚀</h2>

<h3>The company</h3>

<ol>
<li>🦄 Bay-area based, funded, and growing startup in the fintech space. Quite soon, we&rsquo;ll be looking at the U word with hopeful eyes.</li>
<li>💳 Credit Card for people starting their credit journey (think university students in the USA)</li>
<li>📈 SaaS. We&rsquo;re also a &ldquo;credit card-as-a-service&rdquo;, meaning banks and NBFCs can launch their cards through us.</li>
</ol>


<h3>The team and the tech</h3>

<ol>
<li>🌏 Distributed across timezones</li>
<li>👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Variety of backgrounds: Big companies, start-ups, remote teams, co-located teams. Been there, done that.</li>
<li>☕ A warm, friendly bunch of people who are pleasant to work with.</li>
<li>☁️ A mix of classic and cloud-native infra: Django, RDS PostgreSQL, Ruby on Rails, AWS Lambda, Kinesis, DocumentDB, CloudFormation, Dockerized deployments</li>
<li>🤖 Infrastructure as code, immutable infrastructure</li>
</ol>


<h3>What do we expect</h3>

<ol>
<li>You primarily identify as a backend engineer and are comfortable working on the server-side.</li>
<li>You can write non-trivial programs in either Ruby or Python. If you don&rsquo;t know either, you can learn a language quickly.</li>
<li>You can write clean, modular code in either Object-Oriented style or Functional style.</li>
<li>You are fluent in using at least one DB, preferably PostgreSQL, but feel free to surprise us.</li>
<li>You have shipped code to production recently, regularly.</li>
<li>You are driven and care about doing a good job and improving your craft.</li>
<li>You are fluent in using the tools of the trade: Editors, Git, Command line, Slack, Jira (unfortunately yes)</li>
<li>You have high integrity, and you are reliable.</li>
</ol>


<p><strong>Don&rsquo;t worry too much about fitting each of these requirements. Use your discretion, think which are most important to you, and then apply.</strong></p>

<h3>What do you get</h3>

<ol>
<li>💰 Good pay. We&rsquo;re not AmaGooFaceFlixSoft, but we will pay well enough that money alone wouldn&rsquo;t be a blocker for you joining</li>
<li>👩🏼‍🏫 Mentorship and a chance to grow professionally</li>
<li>🕴️ A chance at a career-building stint. Deserve is in excellent shape, and poised to become significant.</li>
<li>🎉 A chance to define the company culture, be a stakeholder in how we do things. Don&rsquo;t like something? Make your case; change it.</li>
<li>🙌🏼 A friendly interview process that you will enjoy participating</li>
</ol>


<h3>When applying, please send us:</h3>

<ol>
<li>Your LinkedIn profile or your resume, preferably both.</li>
<li>A snippet of code you wrote recently and are proud of, and why you are proud of it.</li>
<li>Create a GitHub gist (or equivalent) with the above things, and send it to us through this platform.</li>
</ol>
